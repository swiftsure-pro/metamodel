Mental models,"Cognitive frameworks or representations that aid in understand and interpretting the world, predicting outcomes, and guiding behavior."
Space and Time,"Space and time are the frameworks within which physical reality is structured.
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><b>Space</b>: The three-dimensional continuum in which objects are located and interact.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>Time</b>: The linear progression of events from the past, through the present, to the future. Some metaphysical perspectives consider time to be another dimension, much like space.</li>
</ul>"
Causality,"Causality is the principle that events occur as a result of other events or states of affairs. It establishes a relationship between cause and effect.
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><b>Efficient Causes</b>: Causes that bring something into existence or effect a change.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>Final Causes</b>: The purpose or end for which something is done, a concept especially highlighted in Aristotelian philosophy.</li>
</ul>"
Universals and Particulars,a classical metaphysical distinction about the nature of properties and entities
Possibility and Necessity,"These concepts deal with the nature of existence and non-existence.
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><b>Possible Worlds</b>: Hypothetical realities that represent different ways things could have been.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>Necessary Existence</b>: Entities that must exist in any possible world, such as mathematical truths or logical laws.</li>
</ul>"
Mind and Consciousness,"This component explores the nature of the mind and its relationship to reality.
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><b>Dualism</b>: The view that mind and matter are distinct substances.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>Monism</b>: The belief that only one kind of substance exists, with variations like materialism (only matter exists) and idealism (only mind exists).</li>
</ul>"
Ontology,"The study of being and existence that seek to categorize and understand the nature of entities and their modes of existence.
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><b>Realism</b>: The belief that entities exist independently of perception.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>Nominalism</b>: The view that universals are mere names without inherent reality.</li>
</ul>"
Metaphysical Grounding,"This concept involves the basis upon which reality is constructed.
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>F<b>undamental Entities</b>: The basic building blocks of reality that everything else depends on.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>Grounding Relations</b>: The hierarchical structure that explains how higher-level phenomena arise from more fundamental ones.</li>

Evidence,"Anything presented in support of an assertion, as described <a href=""$inet://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence""><font color=""#0000ff""><u>here</u></font></a>."
Arguments,"Arguments deal with whether claims are true or not, providing reasons to support that claim and implying that the premises make it reasonable to accept the conclusion. In contrast, an explanation describes the mechanism by which something happens, providing causal theories for why something could happen. Explanations may themselves be true or not (i.e. explain adequately why something happens), but they cannot be used as evidence to believe a claim – they make it plausible, but not certain. 

"
Claims,"An <a href=""$inet://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea""><font color=""#0000ff""><u>idea</u></font></a> that someone is trying to convince someone else is true, and which is debatable."
